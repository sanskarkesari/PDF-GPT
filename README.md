# PDF-GPT

## 🚀 Project Overview
PDF-GPT is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions about their content. Using **Gemini Pro**, **vector embeddings**, and **Streamlit**, the project provides an interactive way to extract insights from documents.

## 🔥 Features
- 📂 Upload a PDF and process its content
- 🤖 Ask AI-powered questions about the document
- 🏎️ Fast and efficient search using vector embeddings
- 🎨 User-friendly interface built with Streamlit

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Gemini Pro** (for natural language processing)
- **Vector Embeddings** (for efficient search & retrieval)
- **Streamlit** (for web-based interaction)
- **Python** (core programming language)

## 📌 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanskarkesari/pdf-gpt.git

   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## ⚡ How It Works
1. Upload a PDF file.
2. The document is processed, and vector embeddings are generated.
3. Ask questions related to the document, and the AI provides relevant responses.
